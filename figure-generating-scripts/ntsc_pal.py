- I'm not sure about PAL, but for NTSC it would be more complicated than black & white but not insurmountable.
- There's some filtering needed to get good separation of the colour information, and you have to lock on to the phase of the colour burst.
- It looks like PAL works the same way. There's a 10-cycle colour burst that you lock onto and use that to regenerate the carrier needed to demodulate the colour signal.
- FPV ones defniitely have color
- NTSC is US, PAL is EU, SECAM is france and russia
- Clayton doesnt think it would be too hard, specs are short https://antiqueradio.org/art/NTSC%20Signal%20Specifications.pdf
- clayton wrote straight python for generating color NTSC https://github.com/argilo/grcon22/tree/main/ntsc
- Dani's GRC and ipynb solution for claytons challenge - https://destevez.net/2022/10/grcon22-capture-the-flag/ and https://github.com/daniestevez/grcon22-ctf/blob/main/Never_the_same_color/NTSC.ipynb
- sigmf recording should be here https://ctf-2022.gnuradio.org/
- writeup of how the color system works - https://www.csse.canterbury.ac.nz/greg.ewing/c64_pal_decoder/PAL/PAL-Video-Encoding.html
- another open source code for color tx only is hacktv, uses hackrf
- post of people asking for color to be added to SDRAngel https://github.com/f4exb/sdrangel/issues/21
- Dani says Gonzalo, the author of SigDigger, has done some experiments with color PAL, but not NTSC, although the two are similar
- NTSC is basically the same idea as PAL but without the alternating phase (and with different timing ofc)
- note from a random github issue post - I used the term "PAL" to qualify the frame synchronization scheme which is the one used in PAL (and NTSC and SECAM by the way) and that's all that is PAL there. To implement color is a lot of work because you have to mimic the rather complex analog circuitry that best works in... analog. This implies locking the color oscillator (a NCO then) in frequency and phase with the small burst at the start of the line. Then you need to filter the luminance (LPF) and the chrominance (BPF) apart. You then take the chrominance signal and decode its phase using the reference of the color oscillator. Then you reassemble everything to get the RGB according to the particular standard (PAL, NTSC, SECAM). I beleieve this is a lot of work for just analog color. Now anyone who is up at it is welcome but I will certainly concentrate on more valuable features. In particular it would be more immediately interesting to add support for digital TV.
- it looks like only the audio is FM modulated, not the video!  the video is essentially just AM
- old TV used PAL/NTSC modulated with VSB (hence asymetric PSD), but FPV cameras in 5.8 GHz band use PAL/NTSC FM modulated
- In vestigial sideband (VSB), the full upper sideband of bandwidth (4.0 MHz) is tx, but only 0.75 MHz of the lower sideband is tx, along with a carrier
- They use VSB and not SSB because they have a DC component and SSB would filter that out
- remember that hacktv can also produce fm modulated pal, as well as the different variants of pal
